					<h4>Long Bio</h4>
					<p>I was born in New York City and grew up in Connecticut. After high school, I attended MIT, earning a degree in physics and in economics. I spent my junior year at the University of Cambridge, where I wrote a dissertation on the economics of grid-connected electric vehicles, supervised by Professor David Newbery. My research work at MIT focused on plasma physics, and I had brief research projects both at MIT's Plasma Science Fusion Center and at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.</p>
					<p>Following my time as an undegrad, I joined GE Energy working in Atlanta. My first work was as a software product manager on GE's Grid IQ Insight product line, where I developed a software platform and analytics to help electric utilities to run more efficiently. Afterwards, I led fulfillment efforts on a joint venture with XD Electric, a power equipment manufacturer based in Xian, China.</p>
					<p>After GE, I moved back to Boston to complete an MBA at Harvard Business School. During business school, Will, a fraternity brother from MIT, and I started Tagup. Our goal is to connect industrial equipment around the world to our platform, and use Will's research in machine learning methods to prevent equipment failure.</p>
