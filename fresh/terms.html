IF YOU ARE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND ALL USERS WHO ACCESS OUR SERVICES THROUGH YOUR ACCOUNT TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IN WHICH CASE THE TERMS "YOU" OR "YOUR" SHALL REFER TO SUCH ENTITY, ITS AFFILIATES AND USERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, YOU MUST NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT AND MAY NOT USE THE SERVICES.</p>
					<p>If Tagup makes material changes to these Terms, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our site before the changes are effective.

Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at: https://tagup.io/terms</p>
					<p>Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While Tagup prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that Tagup cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>
					<h3>A. Account Terms</h3>

						<li>You must provide your name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.</li>
						<li>Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.</li>
						<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Tagup cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>

						<li>One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.</li>
						<li>You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>B. API Terms</h3>
					<p>Customers may access their Tagup account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses Tagup, is bound by these Terms of Service plus the following specific terms:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>You expressly understand and agree that Tagup shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Tagup has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>
						<li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Tagup via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Tagup, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Tagup will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.</li>
						<li>Tagup reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</li>

						<li>All paid plans must enter a valid payment account. Free accounts are not required to provide payment account information.</li>
						<li>An upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan will immediately bill you.</li>
						<li>For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account.

						<li>When changing from a monthly billing cycle to a yearly billing cycle, Tagup will bill for a full year at the next monthly billing date.</li>

For upgrades or downgrades while on a yearly plan, Tagup will immediately charge or refund the difference in plan cost, prorated for the remaining time in your yearly billing cycle.</li>
						<li>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Tagup does not accept any liability for such loss.</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>D. Cancellation and Termination</h3>
					<ol>
						You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. You can cancel your account at any time by clicking on the Account link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple no questions asked cancellation link. All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled. If you cancel the Service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again. Tagup, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other Tagup service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your Account or your access to your Account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content in your Account. Tagup reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.
