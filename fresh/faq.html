					<p>Still have questions about how Tagup works and if your equipment is compatible? See some of our commonly answered questions below. If you still have outstanding questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@tagup.io">support@tagup.io</a> and we'll get back to you with the answer.</p>
					<h3>"What kind of equipment can Tagup integrate with?"</h3>
					<p>Generally, any equipment that has an Ethernet or serial (RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485) interface can be connected to the communications hardware we use. Some protocols we suppport out of the box, including Modbus RTU/ASCII, DNP3, and BACnet. For other systems, including those using PLCs from Allen-Bradley, Mitsubishi, and others, we can often build an adapter on the fly, or work with you to get data off of your equipment in a compatible format. </p>
					<p>If your equipment only has analog output, we can interface with 4-20 mA current loops, but this requires additional engineering time and expense.</p>

					<h3>"How does the whole process work?"</h3>
					<p>If you have equipment you'd like to integrate, you can <a href="contact.html">contact us here</a> to start the integration process. Once we've worked with you to understand the technical specifications of the equipment to be integrated, we integrate a test unit, working with your engineering team to make sure all the equipment's data is received and mapped correctly. Depending on the equipment and the level of integration desired, this can take from as little as an hour to as long as a week.</p>
					<p>After we've created your equipment's "digital twin", we connect industrial cellular and/or Wi-Fi hardware (for example, the USRobotics USR3510 or NetComm NTC-140W) to your equipment. For large deployments, we can optionally work with your team to integrate communications hardware directly into your product.</p>
					<h3>"What kind of data will we receive?"</h3>
