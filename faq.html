					<p>Still have questions about how Tagup works and if your equipment is compatible? See some of our commonly answered questions below. If you still have outstanding questions, please email <a href="mailto:support@tagup.io">support@tagup.io</a> and we'll get back to you with the answer.</p>
					<h3>"What kind of equipment can Tagup integrate with?"</h3>
					<p>Generally, any equipment that has an Ethernet or serial (RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485) interface can be connected to the communications hardware we use. Some protocols we support out of the box, including Modbus RTU/ASCII, DNP3, and BACnet. For other systems, including those using PLCs from Allen-Bradley, Mitsubishi, and others, we can often build an adapter on the fly, or work with you to get data off of your equipment in a compatible format. </p>
					<p>If your equipment only has analog output, we can interface with 4-20 mA current loops, but this requires additional engineering time and expense.</p>

					<h3>"How does the whole process work?"</h3>
					<p>If you have equipment you'd like to integrate, you can <a href="contact.html">contact us here</a> to start the integration process. Once we've worked with you to understand the technical specifications of the equipment to be integrated, we integrate a test unit, working with your engineering team to make sure all the equipment's data is received and mapped correctly. Depending on the equipment and the level of integration desired, this can take from as little as an hour to as long as a week.</p>
					<p>After we've created your equipment's "digital twin", we connect industrial cellular and/or Wi-Fi hardware (for example, the USRobotics USR3510 or NetComm NTC-140W) to your equipment. For large deployments, we can optionally work with your team to integrate communications hardware directly into your product.</p>
					<p>Your equipment is now Internet-enabled and ready to be deployed. But wait, there's more! Data from your equipment in the field is sent to our web servers continually. We use this data to train proprietary models to help identify failures or other anomalies. These models can reduce unplanned downtime by notifying you of equipment issues not identified by threshold-based alarms or other indicators.</p>
					<h3>"What kind of data will we receive?"</h3>
					<p>We divide data on equipment into two categories: operation and non-operational data. Operational data includes any data generated by the equipment, for example, sensor readings and control set-points. Non-operational data includes user-added or automatically generated information, including product documentation, inspection reports, photos, etc. Tagup manages both operational and non-operation data on your equipment's behalf.</p>
					<p>You can also receive an email digest daily or weekly summarizing equipment performance across your install base. This will show you important trends in data types, alarms of note, and with deeper levels of product integration, suggested maintenance actions. <a href="mailto:support@tagup.io">Contact us</a> for a demo if you'd like to see in action.</p>

					<h3>"Who controls the data coming off my equipment?"</h3>
					<p>As per our terms of service, you are the sole owner of the data coming off of your equipment. Tagup claims no intellectual property rights on the data provided to our service. The data is stored in US-based web servers managed by Amazon Web Services. We can provision data storage in other countries by customer request, but this requires additional engineering time and expense.</p>
					<p>If necessary, you can <a href="mailto:support@tagup.io">contact support</a> to request the data archive for your equipment. This includes all sensor readings, control data, and non-operational data.</p>

					<h3>"How much does it cost to integrate equipment into the platform?"</h3>

					<p>Cost to integrate depends on various factors. Simple integrations with an established communications protocol, a serial or Ethernet interface, and just a few I/O points can be done in a day and cost around $2,500 as a one-time integration fee. More complex and thorough integrations, with tens or hundreds of I/O points, proprietary protocols, and/or special requests on data visualizations/alerts can take several weeks of engineering time. For these more complex integrations, please <a href="mailto:sales@tagup.io">contact sales</a> for help with budgeting.</p>

					<p>Units in the field are covered under a "Software-as-a-Service" pricing model. The price depends on the amount of data transmitted per unit, the number of units in the field, and the amount of data storage per unit, among other factors. To give you a sense of monthly costs for equipment in the field, this charge can range from $50 to as much as $2200 per month. The cost of the communications hardware is included in this monthly charge. You may authorize an unlimited number of users to access your equipment pages.</p>

					<h3>"How secure is my equipment's data?"</h3>

					<p>Security is core to our platform. We have three primary, publically shared security measures: 1) All data transmitted is encrypted with 128 bit AES. This is end-to-end, that is, data is encrypted from your equipment to our servers, and from our servers to your web browser. 2) Equipment is connected to our web servers via private network (both over cellular and Wi-Fi). Your equipment will not have a publicly-addressable IP. 3) Interfaces with equipment are "read-only". Neither our web servers nor the communications hardware we use accept traffic directed toward you equipment.</p>

					<p>On the application side, you have control over which users can view data on your equipment. It is possible to set limited views for certain classes of users. For example, you as owner of the equipment's record can see all data, but third-party service providers might only be able to see current measurements.</p>

					<h3>"How does the platform demonstration work?"</h3>
					<p>Once you submit your contact information, we'll reach out to you to schedule some time to walk through the application. We have a few units in the field we can show via the application to give you a sense for the capabilities of our platform. This can be done via WebEx or video conference.</p>
					<p>For qualified customers (principally, manufacturers, value added resellers, and equipment end users with large install bases), we can integrate in a "test unit". This can be any piece of equipment you manufacture, install, or operate that has an Ethernet or serial interface. Interested in seeing how it can change the way you manage your equipment data?
