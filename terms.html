                        <ol>
                            <li>You expressly understand and agree that Tagup shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Tagup has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>
                            <li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Tagup via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. Tagup, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Tagup will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.</li>
                            <li>Tagup reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</li>

                            <li>For monthly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable.

                            <li>For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level while on a monthly billing cycle, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.

                            <li>Downgrading your Service may cause the loss of Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Tagup does not accept any liability for such loss.</li>

                        <h3>D. Cancellation and Termination</h3>
